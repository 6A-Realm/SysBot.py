## Should I use this bot?
If you want to use this for SysBot:

	No. It barely works, I did it for fun. Use [SysBot.NET](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET) instead.
	- There is no legality checks and there is no pkx or pbx conversion. 
	- I did not implement anything with offsets other than b1s1.
	- This was more for fun. Use the other bot for actual SysBot use.
    
If you want to use this for other features:

	I personally use it along side SysBot.NET.
	It has some nice features, especially if the bot is used in multiple servers.

## Something doesn't work correctly:
Not everything is tested and I doubt everything will work as expected.
- If you want to open an issue then I might take a look at it. If you want to fork and fix then I could always pull as well.

## Support:
Ask nicely and I might have an answer
