## Should I use this bot?
If you want to use this for SysBot:

	Personally, no. It barely works, I did it for fun.
	- There is no legality checks and there is no pkx or pbx conversion. 
	- I did not implement anything with offsets other than b1s1.
    
If you want to use this for other features:

	- I personally use it along side SysBot.NET.
	- It has some nice features, especially if the bot is used in multiple servers.
    - Gives you way more control over your server and your bot. 
    - Easier remote control handling and debugging. 

## Something doesn't work correctly:
Not everything is tested and I doubt everything will work as expected.
- If you want to open an issue then I might take a look at it. If you want to fork and fix then I could always pull as well.

## Support:
Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/6A-Realm/SysBot.py/wiki) before asking questions. If you still cannot figure it out, ask nicely and I might have an answer.
