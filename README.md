## Should I use this bot?
If you want to use this for SysBot:

	Personally, I would not use this as a SysBot.NET replacement just yet.
	- I did not implement anything with offsets other than injection; therefore, 
	the client does not really know which screen the switch it exactly on. 
	It assumes you are on certain screens.
    
If you want to use this for other features:

	- I personally use it along side SysBot.NET.
	- It has some nice features, especially if the bot is used in multiple servers.
    - Gives you way more control over your server and your bot. 
    - Easier remote control handling and debugging. 

## Something doesn't work correctly:
Open an issue with the following information: 
- Command
- Expectations
- Output/Results
- List errors using the command `jsk debug <command>`

## Support:
Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/6A-Realm/SysBot.py/wiki) before asking questions. If you still cannot figure it out, ask nicely and I might have an answer.
